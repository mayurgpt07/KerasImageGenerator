# KerasImageGenerator
[Kaggle Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview) - Identify dog breed using the images provided <br />
Code: Use Keras image generator to load the data and train a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) <br />
Usecase: Automatically read images and categories without explicitly converting each image into an array of data points 

Requirements:
1) [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) Folders - Train and Test data folders must be present
2) labels.csv - Mapping of image id and category (dog breed)

Steps: 
1) Run DogBreed.py - Creates a new directory structure with images images of similar breed in a single folder
2) Run DogBreedClassification.py - Trains a CNN for dog breed identification
